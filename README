"Detailed" informations on how to setup HRJobs you'll find in:

./public_html/doc/index.html

check the documentation with a text browser e.g. 

> lynx ./public_html/doc/index.html

or 

> w3m ./public_html/doc/index.html

Quick Installation.

1. create a database including the db structure located in ./etc/mysql
   we assume, the database will be named "hrjobs". 

pkg_hrjobs # mysqladmin -uroot create hrjobs
pkg_hrjobs # cat etc/mysql/create_tables.sql | mysql -u root hrjobs


2. add a user to your hrjobs DB, eg. on the mysql console

mysql> grant all on hrjobs.* to hrjobsUser@localhost identified by "secret";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

3. access the hrjobs package via a webbrowser

copy the ./config-dist.xml to ./config/config.xml and make sure that it is
writable by the webserver.

eg: http://localhost/hrjobs/public_html

The first time you should be redirected to some setup forms which will check 
varios system settings an will give you the possibility to enter
configuration options.
